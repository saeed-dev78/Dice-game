# Dice-game

this game is one of my best projects with JavaScript.
there are some tips that you need to familar with them

1. if you get 100 scores, you are the winner. congratulations:))))
2. if you click on 'Role Dice' button, you can get a random dice number
3. if you click on 'Hold' button, you can hold and save your score on a local host
4. you need to roll the dice again and again to get 100 scores.
5. only there is one exceptional rule; if you roll the dice and get number 1, you can't keep going. so, it's your competitor's turn.

6. I hope you like my game.

7. best of luck
